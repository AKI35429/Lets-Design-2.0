This First Task is for you to show off your Typography Skills.
Typography helps create harmony and consistency in a design. The main purpose of typography is to make life easier for your readership by making it easier to read what you've written: It makes it possible to to quickly scan your text. It entices your readers to engage with your text. When done well, it enhances the message it presents.

This task can be done in Google Docs or Figma [ Use A4 frame, if going for figma ].

## **Procedure:**

1. Skim through the given text once and define the **Hierarchy** i.e., mark Headings/ Sub-headings/ Important points.
2. Decide the Font/ Type-face you would be using according to the context of the text. You can do font-pairing i.e, use different font for Headings/ Sub-headings but, don't loose the **Consistency**. 
3. Check for margins and spacings. Don't forget to provide enough **white spaces**. The proper use of white space ensures an excellent user experience and a great readability experience. It helps to balance design elements and better organize content to improve the visual communication experience. 
4. For Submission you would have to provide the link to the doc file/ figma frame in a text file (Named after your github username) and make sure to keep the file in **"Typography Task"** folder only.
