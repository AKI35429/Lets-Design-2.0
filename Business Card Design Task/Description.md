This Second Task is for you to show off your Visual Design Skills and Minimal Thinking. 
A Business Card represents your company's brand. Not only does it convey important personal contact information such as name, title, email, website, address, and phone number, but often it is also the first exposure to the overall image of the business.

In this task, you have to design a **Minimal Business card for GeekHaven**. Which must have been pretty much clear by the name of the issue...ðŸ¤£. You can use both sides of the card ( front and back ) for designing.

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

The business card should obviously look like a business card and not like any other form of print media. Since it is a 20 point task we are expecting proper use of two of the design principles: Alignment and Proximity. This includes visual connection of elements with each other, arrangement of content in logical groups, and proper utilization of white space. The card should not look cluttered, while also not missing the important contents. It should have an extremely well-defined order of importance of hierarchy. 
</br>
If you feel scared while reading these principlesðŸ˜‚ then no worries, you can either refer to the respective chapters in "The Non-Designers Design book" or a shorter way is to ping us on discord and we will help you familiarise with the usage of these principlesðŸ˜‡.
