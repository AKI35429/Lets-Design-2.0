Open-code : Mascot

Type of Mascot : Animal
Animal Name : Viper(snake)

Why I choose this?
Because:
-> Personality of character :
   Viper is a savage , confident and clever and a great observation just like we do while contribution.
   
-> Poses, Emotions, Outfits, and Scenes :
   Always be in attentive position to search new things (just like we can explore open source ideas with very keen interests)
   
   Searching while Wearing specs (just like we search for diff diff issues while colaboration)
  
   Who doesn't fear enemies, in fact desires the enemies' fear. Just like her abilities, she can be quite "toxic", however she/he is seen
   being more amiable and caring towards her teammates(just like while contributing to a big and great project we should not fear about any other developers 
   we should focus on ourself and confident while contributing and also we are taking care of our developers community by contributing).
   
   In OpenCode open source program, we have to be clever and fast to claim the new issues first so as to take the issue of our choice because 
   every developer has to be ready to claiming and resolving the new issues and thinking innovatively so we have to be so fast to take issue first just like visper tongue
   smells the new issues😁.
   
   SO all this inspiration we can get from my mascot:->Viper(snake)
