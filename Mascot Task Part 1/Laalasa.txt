About Zeki:
Zeki is a purple-colored alien who previously resided on Exoplanet. Zeki is extremely intelligent in comparison to his peers, and as a result, none of his classmates speak with him. So, he builds a spaceship to travel around the universe. However, his spaceship gets disrupted by his clumsiness, and he crashes into the planet OpenCode. He intends to reconstruct his spaceship, but he needs some aid, so he begins to contribute to OpenCode. With his dedication, he soon crosses everyone on the leaderboard. Now he doesn't want to go back to his planet and stays in OpenCode happily contributing.
