OPENCODE MASCOT

1. Choose the right character

I would like to choose robot as my character as OpenCode is based on technology.
We get exposure of different technical wings. So choosing something technical was appropriate.

2.Create the personality of your character

I would like to character to have a full enthusiasm as OpenCode will be a journey of learning, so one must be enthusiastic.

3.Plan Poses, Emotions, Outfits, and Scenes

I would like the pose to be some like dancing and having PR in his hand , happiness on its face. It would be wearing a contributor hoodie.
Talking abou scene it must be showing contributing to a mentor happily.
