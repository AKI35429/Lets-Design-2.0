OpenCode - Mascot

Type of Mascot:  Animal
Animal: phoenix
It is because phoenix never dies and so do open source projects- open code a one month event.

Personality:
the phoenix flies far ahead to the front.
In this opencode event, every developer has to be ready claiming and resolving the new issues and thinking innovatively as phoenix.

In this opencode event we have to stay focused throughout the time we resolve an issue.As phoenix being attentive all time.
These are all the inspiration we could get from “phoeny”- the mascot of Opencode.
