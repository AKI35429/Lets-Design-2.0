This would be the final task and an easy one.

All you need to do is to make a simple minimal poster on the **theme of open-source or open-code**. This task is not about your expertise in certain design tools, rather based on your design thinking skills and creativity.

You can use any design tool for this task.

## **Submission Guideline:**

- Submit the illustrator file in the "The Final task" Folder only.
- Paste a jpg/png file of your design in the Pull Request.

## **Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)**

The idea must be original. If submission of a similar design has already been made, then the submission done later would not be accepted and might be penalized. 

No changes will be suggested. The final decision resides with the Mentors and Organizers, no claim can be made on their decision.
