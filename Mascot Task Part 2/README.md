**OPEN TO ALL
No need to claim this issue**

You have to design the mascot for OpenCode based on any one of the two ideas mentioned below. You can use any tool to design for this task. The mascot is different from a logo (look at the example below). The mascot should be a full-body illustration. Since it may be used as the official OpenCode mascot, only quality submissions will be accepted.

## Option-1 [Submission by @schandu-eng]

**Name of Mascot:** folk-Z
**Type of Mascot:** Animal
**Why I chose Animal as a mascot:** To associate with the organization’s motto and values.
**Animal:** Fox
**Why fox:** The fox is a symbol of intelligence, cunningness, and slyness.

**Description:** 
Folk-Z, a very seasoned developer from IIITA, once came to know about the OpenCode event conducted by Geekhaven IIITA. Looking at the exciting prize pool, folk-Z became very greedy. He tried every possible method to selfishly claim as many issues as possible and earn points.
He was the overall winner of that year's open code.
A few days later folk-Z got a project idea but realized that he had no one to share the idea with. The feeling of loneliness hit him hard. Looking back he pointed out that in his journey he became a very good coder but not a good “contributor” and was unsuccessful in building a network/community. From then onwards folk-z voluntarily took over the responsibility of encouraging young and budding developers to form and contribute to a healthy community thus becoming a representative of open code. Presently folk-Z guides new developers through the OpenCode in their open-source and development journey and continuously educates them with his experience.

**Personality traits:**
Clever, Cunning, Matured, Helpful, Night Owl (typical engineer), A good friend

In OpenCode too you need intelligence and independent thinking to solve the issues in your own way. You have to be observant to claim the issue first and should have the courage to even solve some issues out of your comfort zone to learn something new. All of the above, to learn something new you should have a powerful intuition that you can do it and climb the leaderboard to the top...

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

The final decision remains in the hands of mentors and Organizers, based on the effectiveness of the idea, your justification for the idea, and how closely it represents OpenCode.
