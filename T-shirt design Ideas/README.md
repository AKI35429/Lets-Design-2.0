OPEN TO ALL
No submission will be accepted after **31st October 6:00 PM**

So we are stuck and need your help ðŸ˜…! Offering 20 points in return though. We need ideas for OpenCode T-shirt. Don't worry you don't need to know about t-shirt designing specifics or get into some professional designing. Just look around and browse through some t-shirts on google then try to come up with ideas for the T-shirt depicting the theme of open source and Opencode. 

You need to sketch the ideas in your notebook. Professional sketching is not required but your idea should be clear from the sketch and should be good for an actual t-shirt


## Submission Guideline

- Sketch your ideas in a notebook. Professional sketching is not required but the drawing should be clear enough to explain the idea and should be feasible for an actual t-shirt
- If you think your idea is awesome but your drawing skills are not, try to sketch as best as you can and attach with it an explanation of what you wanted to draw and convey
- The idea must be original - "May the open source be with you", "Github - The place where I fork" and other such common ideas will not be accepted
- Submit a clear photo of your sketch (and explanation, if required) in the "**T-Shirt Design Ideas**" Folder Only

## Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)

Since the idea will be used for an actual t-shirt only the ideas which are good enough to be implemented will be accepted. The decision is purely subjective and will be based on the review of mentors and organizers only. No claim can be made on the judgment.
